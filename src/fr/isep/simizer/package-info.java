/**
 * Provides the entry point for the simulation.
 * <p>
 * This package provides two classes to help with the simulation.  The first is
 * the {@link fr.isep.simizer.Simulation} class, which can be used in custom
 * applications that link against the Simizer framework to run a simulation.
 * This allows for the most control and customized behavior when using the
 * framework.
 * <p>
 * The other class allows the package to be run as an executable, and that
 * executable is capable of generating and running trace files.  This can allow
 * some particular configuration parameter to be varied and tested against the
 * same test data to compare results.  Note that this functionality is currently
 * under development.
