Version 0.9.0.1
---------------

  When writing the first tutorial that linked against the v0.9 version of the
  framework, I found a few bugs or minor things that needed to be changed.
  Those changes are:

    - fixing an infinite loop in clients that send a specific number of requests
      before finishing

    - renaming one of the laws (UniLaw -> ConstantLaw) to make its purpose more
      obvious, as well as to reduce confusion with the UniformLaw

    - allowing RequestFactory instances to be created without needing to store
      the templates in a file.  This simplified the first tutorial.

Version 0.9
-----------

  This is the first marked release.  I put it in place so that it is easier to
  quickly find versions of the examples that are associated with particular
  versions of the framework.

  In this version of the code, most of the commenting is completed, and most of
  the unused classes have been removed.  (They can still be easily re-added from
  the history of the repository, however -- that's the beauty of source
  control.)
